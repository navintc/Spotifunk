# Spotifunk 2
Trying to make a decentralized peer-to-peer spotify music sharing application to send songs to Tharindu, Kasun &amp; Vileka

### What happened to Spotifunk 1?
Okay, Spotifunk was created with .NET Core, which doesnt have enought support for Databases in it. Therefore, Spotifunk 2 was created fresh with .NET Framework.

### How to run this?
Well my friend, at the moment, you cant. This is still in development state that, you cant even test it proprly.
