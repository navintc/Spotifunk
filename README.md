# Spotifunk 2
Trying to make a decentralized peer-to-peer spotify music sharing application to send songs to Tharindu, Kasun &amp; Vileka

### What happened to Spotifunk 1?
Okay, Spotifunk was created with .NET Core, which doesnt have enought support for Databases in it. Therefore, all development for `Spotifunk 1` was dropped. Then, `Spotifunk 2` was created fresh with .NET Framework. --But if you still want to check `Spotifunk 1` out, it is still this repository under the `sf1-main` branch.

### How to run this?
Well my friend, at the moment, you cant. This is still in development state that, you cant even test it proprly.
